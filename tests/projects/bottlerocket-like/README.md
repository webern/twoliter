# Bottlerocket-like

This project simulates the requirements of the Bottlerocket mono-repo prior to its use of kits.
This project does not rely on any external packages and creates a non-functioning variant image (it has no kernal or core packages).

The purpose of the project is to build quickly and test for regressions in `twoliter make` or `twoliter build variant`.
